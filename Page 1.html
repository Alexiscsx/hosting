<body bgcolor="B8AFAB"><center><h2><font color="yellow" font face="Tahoma"><h1><strong>Pulp Fiction</h1></font></strong></h2><br>Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) are two hit men who are out to retrieve a suitcase<br>stolen from their employer, mob boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames).<br>Wallace has also asked Vincent to take his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out a few days later when Wallace himself will be out of town.<br>An aging boxer is paid by Wallace to lose his fight. The lives of these seemingly unrelated people<br>are woven together comprising of a series of funny, bizarre and uncalled-for incidents.<br></center><br><br>

	<table width="100%"><tr><td width="35%"><img src="m.jpg"  class="png" alt="Image Not Found" height="100" width="100"><b><font size="+2">Mia Wallace</font></b><br>Mia is Marsellus's wife, and for that reason is one of the most potentially dangerous characters for Vincent to interact with in the entire film. Mia is a failed actress who was in a television pilot named "Fox Force Five" that never made it to air. She has a cocaine addiction that causes her much strife later in the film. </td><td rowspan="2" width="30%"><center><img src="PR_Final_TobyG JuanP.jpg" alt="Image Not Found" height="500" width="250"></center></td><td width="35%"><p align="right"><b><font size="+2">Vincent Vega</font></b><img src="v.jpg"  class="png" alt="Image Not Found" height="100" width="100"><br>Vincent Vega is a heroin addict who, like Jules, is an associate of Marsellus Wallace's. Despite being an addict and a murderer, Vincent can also be likable and sensitive, such as when he explains to Jules the finer qualities of a foot massage, or when he mobilizes to save Mia's life. Vincent can also be prickly and defensive, such as when he spars with Butch at the bar, or chafes at Winston Wolfe's workmanlike demeanor.</p></td></tr>
		<tr><td width="35%"><img src="Sam.jpg"  class="png" alt="Image Not Found" height="100" width="100"><b><font size="+2">Jules Winnfield</font></b><br>Jules Winnfield is a remorseless killer, a hitman for the crime-lord Marsellus Wallace. Jules never eats pork, and invokes the Bible before performing executions. Jules's cool disposition is occasionally ruffled by his partner Vincent Vega, with whom he quarrels about issues both small and large. After Jules is miraculously spared by a hail of bullets, an act he considers "divine intervention," he reconsiders his life of crime.</td><td width="35%"><p align="right"><b><font size="+2">Marsellus Wallace</font></b><img src="mrm.jpg"  class="png" alt="Image Not Found" height="100" width="100"><br>Marsellus Wallace is a drug dealer who is the central node connecting every character in the film. Marsellus's face is not shown until more than halfway through the movie. Intelligent and powerful, Marsellus is feared by everyone, especially Vincent, who must race to save Mia's life lest Marsellus order his execution.</p></td></tr></table><br><br>
